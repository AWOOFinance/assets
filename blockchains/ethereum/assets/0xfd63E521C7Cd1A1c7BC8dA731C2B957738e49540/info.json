    "description": "AWOO! Finance is an ERC20 project whose main focus is to provide care and well-being of dogs around the world. All AWOO transactions are subject to three dynamic fees: a 1 to 5% fee that is collected into a partner's wallet to be donated to charitable causes; a 1 to 5% fee that is redistributed to holders proportionally; a 1 to 3% fee that goes to marketing, liquidity and general cash-flow to continue to operate. Every fee change is voted, as well as charity wallet and outgoing transactions.",
